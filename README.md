# World-University-Ranking-Project-Analysis

**PROJECT OVERVIEW**

About the data set: This dataset compares global university rankings from three major sources: 

**Times Higher Education (THE)**, founded in the UK in 2010, is known for evaluating universities based on teaching, research, and industry income but has faced criticism for its commercialization and bias against non-English institutions.
 
**Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU)**, also known as the Shanghai Ranking, started in China in 2003. It focuses heavily on research output and has been criticized for neglecting humanities and teaching quality.
 
**Center for World University Rankings (CWUR)**, founded in Saudi Arabia in 2012, is a newer ranking that looks at education quality, faculty, and research, but isn’t as well-known or influential as the others. 

These rankings provide a varied perspective on university performance, reflecting different criteria and areas of emphasis. The World University Rankings’ dataset is an external source. The data was sourced from Kaggle, a platform known for its comprehensive datasets and analytics competitions. 

**Motivation:** To gain valuable insights into global university rankings, helping students, educators, and policymakers make informed decisions. Th edataset aims to bring transparency to the evaluation processes of different ranking systems, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. By benchmarking university performance, institutions can identify areas for improvement and restrategize accordingly. 

**Objective:** The objective of this dataset analysis is to evaluate ranking criteria, and provide insights for students, educators, and policymakers.
